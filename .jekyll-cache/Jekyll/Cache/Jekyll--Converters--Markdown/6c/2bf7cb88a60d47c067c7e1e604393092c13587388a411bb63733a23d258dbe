I"w	<p>Hii there,</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.github.com/null-sys/">Gaurav</a>, senior at <a href="https://www.nitandhra.ac.in/main/">National Institute of Technology Andhra Pradesh</a> pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Computer Vision</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Machine Learning</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cloud Computing</code>. In my spare time I like to read books, sketch cartoons and workout. For development I use MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and Node.js).</p>

<h2 id="my-motive">My Motive</h2>

<p>One day, I was strolling over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/untagged.sparrow/">Instagram</a> and I came across a post by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dev.jeanrauwers/">Jean Rauwers</a>, a UK based software engineer, offering a <a href="http://italktech.io/socialLinks/">FREE bootcamp on MERN</a>. I skipped it at first but after about 30 minutes, I came back and went through first episode. It is one of the finest courses on MERN Stack. It kept fueling my interest. Now, I am developing my own app based on MERN stack. Thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dev.jeanrauwers/">Jean Rauwers</a>.</p>

<p>It was interesting to find such thing on Instagram. Link to his <a href="http://italktech.io/socialLinks/">blog</a>. You can find all details there. Do follow him on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dev.jeanrauwers/">Instagram</a> for weekly QnA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dev.jeanrauwers/">Jean Rauwersâ€™s</a> suggested to create more online presence and contribute to open-source. It helps developer community as well as job offers. Thus I am here, just putting something out there.</p>
