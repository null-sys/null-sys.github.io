I"<p>Welcome to Carte Noire.</p>

<p>Carte Noire is a free theme for Jekyll developed by <a href="http://www.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/">Jacob Tomlinson</a>. I am grateful for this beautiful theme.</p>

<p>The theme has been designed with simplicity and readability in mind. It makes
use of third party services such as Disqus ad AddThis to ensure the blog has
all the features you would expect from a dynamic application such as Wordpress
but with the hosting and maintenance simplicity of Jekyll.</p>

<p>Please use/copy/share Carte Noire!</p>
