<p>My tutor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vvashishtha/">Vaibhav Vashishtha</a> came up with this great idea of a project which is concurrent and useful. He allowed me to use it for this series.</p>

<p>In simple terms, the project is to develop a covid journal application where a patient can put his thoughts and vitals. It will be stored and shared.</p>

<p>Before we get started we need a tech-savvy name for our application. I am thinking <em>Blaze Covid - A journal</em>. Now letâ€™s understand how to do a requirement analysis.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-perform-requirement-analysis">How do we perform requirement analysis?</h2>

<p>There are lot of methods to do requirement analysis but mostly <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories">User stories</a> is the one being followed in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto">agile</a> projects. It simply goes in a hierarchal fashion like this -</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/user-story.jpg" alt="Epic archetecture" /></p>

<p>There will be many epics and then each epic will be broken into user stories. Then each user story will be broken into tasks and then we complete these tasks. But epics and user stories help us understand the user requirement from the application.</p>

<h2 id="blaze-covid---a-journal">Blaze Covid - A journal</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s start with what the user needs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Epic 1: User login and registration with entry creation</p>

    <ul>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can login into the application</li>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can Register to the application</li>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can enter my vitals</li>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can enter my thoughts and feelings as blog
<br /><br /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Epic 2: User can view and share his entry</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can see all my entries</li>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can see entries with specific #hashtag</li>
      <li>User Story: As a user, I can share my entry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, my needs are thes, and I will try to finish them. These may change along the way and so we will repeat the cycle in an agile manner. But this is just what we understood from the user. We donâ€™t know what are the technical requirements and design of the application. So now we move to the next phase of Design.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-front-development">Back to front development</h2>

<p>I got accustomed to developing databases, backend, and then frontend. So I will be doing three <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints">sprints</a>. One for database design,the second for backend, and the last one for frontend. Though sprints are meant to be done based on functional requirement. I am using here just as an introduction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sprint 1: Database Development</li>
  <li>Sprint 2: Backend Development</li>
  <li>Sprint 3: Frontend Development</li>
</ul>
