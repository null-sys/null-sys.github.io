I"…<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am going under training in Publicis Sapient and I have an amazing tutor [Vaibhav Vashishtha][]. I am understanding new and quite a lot of things.</p>

<p>Even thought we are going to develop a full stack application but this FS101 series is going to act a exploring guide rather than a begineers tutorial. I will cover design process and code development but you have to create setups and learn every new word comes across you.</p>

<p>This is just a bridge between knowing how to code and developing a good full stack project.</p>

<h2 id="full-stack-structure">Full Stack Structure</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/client_server.jpg" alt="Client Server Archetecture" /></p>

<p>Above image shows a conventional sturucture of most web applications currently developed. In development we follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over configuration</a>. So you understand what we have on browser is client side and itâ€™s know as frontend. Backend is used to control main bussiness logic and whatever is served to client via http.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-full-stack-development-work">How does Full Stack Development work?</h2>

<p>To keep it simple, there are few stages on how a project is developed. These are called <strong>Software Development Cycles</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Requirement Analysis</code>: A user gives you his/her needs, you try to understand them and break them into chunks of features. We will go on a length about this in another blog.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Design</code>: You know the features by previous stage, now you design the blueprint. There are a lot of blueprint techniques for the development. There are three mainly
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/">Wireframes</a> for User Interface(UI).</li>
      <li><a href="https://tallyfy.com/uml-diagram/">Unified Modeling Language</a> for modeling the project.</li>
      <li><a href="https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/e-r-model-in-dbms/">Entity Relation Diagram</a> for databases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Development</code>: Here your programming and framework knowledge will be tested. This is the coding part we jump directly into.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Testing</code>: There are many types of testing. But two of the most important types are as following
    <ul>
      <li>Unit Testing: Done simultaneously with code(Hey, Google Test driver development).</li>
      <li>QA Testing: Quality Assurance testing before delivery.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deployment</code>: It a different story with cloud services, dockers, and automation tools. As a student, you just need to understand how it is done.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maintenance</code>: This stage comes with real life project where your code is not sitting on github, but it is deployed and you need to maintain.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know it looks like most of the theory but we will see real applications coming along. The above-mentioned part is just the development cycle. This cycle can be repeated multiple times in a Full Stack Development process giving a new term <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Agile Development</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-the-hack-is-full-stack-development">So what the <em>hack</em> is Full Stack Development?</h2>

<p>Now you know about the Software development cycle. To achieve this cycle there are few tools related to each phase. You need to know them, at least up to the testing phase.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Requirement Analysis</code>: Capturing User Stories with tools like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>. But we can do fine with just drill-down points. Itâ€™s the process that matters.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Design</code> <a href="https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/">Wireframes</a> (can be done on paper), <a href="https://tallyfy.com/uml-diagram/">Unified Modeling Language</a>, <a href="https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/e-r-model-in-dbms/">Entity Relation Diagram</a></li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Development</code>: There are many development stacks such as</p>

    <ul>
      <li>MERN - JavaScript - MongoDB - Express - React - Node.js</li>
      <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> - Source Code Management</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Testing</code>: There are few unit testing tools like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/junit/index.htm">junit</a> for java</li>
</ul>

<p>Understand this process and developing using such tools is known as full stack development.</p>

<p>A Full stack project will have the following :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Frontend</li>
  <li>Backend</li>
  <li>Database</li>
</ol>

<p>And just like that, you are a full stack developer. (I assumed you developed one XD).</p>
