## A quick update about me

I survived 2020. I have joined Publicis Sapient as Associate Software Engineer Developer. Currently, I am under training and I am learning a lot of things. PJP program by Publicis Sapient gave me a whole new insight into Full Stack Development. I am very grateful to my tutor [Vinod Kumar Kayartaya][1] and [Vaibhav Vashishtha][4]. With a new level of inspiration, I am starting this FS101 series where I will discuss Full stack development mostly focus on the Browser interface i.e. Web Application development.

## Full Stack Development

Full Stack Developments involves end-to-end delivery of product from understanding user needs to working application deployment. Most Campus Hire jobs focus full stack development. It is obvious to conclude that you need one full stack application in your resume to get considered for these roles. How do we start? Before jumping to the project development you need to understand how the whole process with Full Stack Development.

## How does Full Stack Development work?

To keep it simple, there are few stages on how a project is developed. These are called **Software Development Cycles**.

- `Requirement Analysis`: A user gives you his/her needs, you try to understand them and break them into chunks of features. We will go on a length about this in another blog.
- `Design`: You know the features by previous stage, now you design the blueprint. There are a lot of blueprint techniques for the development. There are three mainly
  - [Wireframes][2] for User Interface(UI).
  - [Unified Modeling Language][3] for modeling the project.
  - [Entity Relation Diagram][4] for databases.
- `Development`: Here your programming and framework knowledge will be tested. This is the coding part we jump directly into.
- `Testing`: There are many types of testing. But two of the most important types are as following
  - Unit Testing: Done simultaneously with code(Hey, Google Test driver development).
  - QA Testing: Quality Assurance testing before delivery.
- `Deployment`: It a different story with cloud services, dockers, and automation tools. As a student, you just need to understand how it is done.
- `Maintenance`: This stage comes with real life project where your code is not sitting on github, but it is deployed and you need to maintain.

I know it looks like most of the theory but we will see real applications coming along. The above-mentioned part is just the development cycle. This cycle can be repeated multiple times in a Full Stack Development process giving a new term [Agile Development][6].

## So what the _hack_ is Full Stack Development?

Now you know about the Software development cycle. To achieve this cycle there are few tools related to each phase. You need to know them, at least up to the testing phase.

- `Requirement Analysis`: Capturing User Stories with tools like [JIRA][6]. But we can do fine with just drill-down points. It's the process that matters.
- `Design` [Wireframes][2] (can be done on paper), [Unified Modeling Language][3], [Entity Relation Diagram][4]
- `Development`: There are many development stacks such as

  - MERN - JavaScript - MongoDB - Express - React - Node.js
  - [Git][7] - Source Code Management

- `Testing`: There are few unit testing tools like [junit][8] for java

Understand this process and developing using such tools is known as full stack development.

A Full stack project will have the following :

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. Database

And just like that, you are a full stack developer. (I assumed you developed one XD).
