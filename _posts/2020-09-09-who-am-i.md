Hii there,

I am [Gaurav][1], senior at [National Institute of Technology Andhra Pradesh][2] pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in `Computer Vision`, `Machine Learning` and `Cloud Computing`. In my spare time I like to read books, sketch cartoons and workout. For development I use MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and Node.js). 

## My Motive

One day, I was strolling over [Instagram][3] and I came across a post by [Jean Rauwers][4], a UK based software engineer, offering a [FREE bootcamp on MERN][5]. I skipped it at first but after about 30 minutes, I came back and went through first episode. It is one of the finest courses on MERN Stack. It kept fueling my interest. Now, I am developing my own app based on MERN stack. Thanks to [Jean Rauwers][4].

It was interesting to find such thing on Instagram. Link to his [blog][5]. You can find all details there. Do follow him on [Instagram][4] for weekly QnA. 

[Jean Rauwers's][4] suggested to create more online presence and contribute to open-source. It helps developer community as well as job offers. Thus I am here, just putting something out there.

## What can you expect ?

* Introduction to Software Engineers : Developers such as Jean Rauwers will be introduced and there work will be highlighted.
* Development Tips : Being in 4th year (Senior), I will be working on few projects. I will come across frameworks too. I will share whatever seems useful
* Interview and Placement Tips : I am facing campus placements, So there will be a few tips on the way.
* Project Ideas : Putting out some ideas for projects.
* And problems that cross my path as developer :/
